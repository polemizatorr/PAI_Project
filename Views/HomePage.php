    <p>TeachUp Private Lessons is a Web Application created
    for student and tutors to help them find someone to giving or taking
    private lessons. There is a possibility of creating profiles and
    defining there if you want to work as a tutor, hire a tutor or
    both of these - you can declare subjects which you're able to teach
    or those which u want to be taught and what level of subject
    are you interested in.<br><br> There's a possibility of chatting with
    users whose advertisements interested you - All that stuff totally free!
    We are not interested in getting commission for making this place for users -
     You choose the offer which is attractive for you, including the cost declared
    by a tutor, or pay offered by student.<br><br> You can discuss conditions of your
    cooperative work - the portal owners are not interested in it - that's your
    private cases. TeachUp will soon offer possibility of e-learning on our portal - it's one
    of new innovations we're currently working on to improve quality of our
    portal services.</p>
